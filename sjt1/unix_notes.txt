Unix Features:
All Data in plaintext files
Many small programs
input-output redirection - can combine the small programs to accomplish complex tasks instead of writing one big program.

Unix philosophy:  be lazy
never retype same command

Keep lines to less than 80 characters

use “which” to find the file and verify it exists

path address location are all synonymous

-t shows you which files were modified last

-r reverses order

verify truth with -l

ctrl c - stops rapid scrolling

\ is an escape character in unix - can use instead of quotes for spaces

Make files all lower case by default
Don’t use spaces - use underscore or dashes

# is the comment command for all shells

less - a pager

: tells you you’re in pager mode

use / to search

every output can become the input of another program
